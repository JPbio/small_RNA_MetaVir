# small_RNA_MetaVir
An automated pipeline for viral metagenomics using small RNA reads. The biological principle for this approach is that the RNAi based immune system of a host during a viral infection will generate viral derived small RNAs that can be sequenced and used for viral contigs assembly for new viruses discovery and to analyze small RNA profiles related to this contgs to get biological information about the host/virus interaction.

###Pipeiline being finished at this moment, please contact me if you are instersted in using it in the current unfinished version
